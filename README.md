# Battery Metadata Schemas

This is a community repository for schemas for battery data and metadata. 

The `schemas` folder contains a series of "modular" schemas
which serve as building blocks for defining data formats for
specific kinds of battery data.

The `formats` folder contains a few example data formats 
that are composed from the data formats themselves.

_Note_: The location of this repository on MDF's GitHub is temporary.
We will eventually move it to a standard location accessible to all
of the battery data working group.
